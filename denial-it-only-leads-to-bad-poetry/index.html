Weak, bald, and lacking an immune system, I couldn't leave the rental apartment where my mother and I were staying except to go to the hospital. Even then, I had to wear a face mask and avoid touching surfaces.</p><p>The mortality rate for this kind of transplant was 30%. When I "went inpatient" in October of 2005, the doctors told me that I should prepare myself for one of the patients in the rooms on either side of mine—children, because I was in a pediatric ward—to die.</p><p>We all ignored the subtext that I was one of the 3 in that morbid math problem. As it turned out, they were right to warn me, though I wasn't told who it was until later.</p><p>Today, I try to imagine what that experience must have been like for my mom. I spent most of the first month heavily drugged and waking up only to vomit, followed by months of grueling recovery and isolation. For a parent, the worst thing imaginable must be to sit beside your child, unable to do anything while terrible things happen to her. But my mother is made of sturdy stuff.</p><p>Why am I painting this dismal picture?</p><p>Because on January 2nd, 2006, I wrote the following mediocre poem in the bedroom of our hospital-approved hypoallergenic rental apartment:</p><h2>CRUEL SHAKESPEARE</h2><p>Goodnight Sweet Prince,<br>and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.<br>Those words, in my mind<br>so clearly meant for a sleeping child,<br>warm and milk-scented.<br>Said for a dying prince, the sweetness is tainted;<br>Lady Macbeth’s spot on Hamlet’s last line--<br>The blood won’t come out.</p><p>Poems always reveal more than the writer expects, don't they?</p><p>At the time, I remember thinking that I was simply playing with literary references, but I clearly had death and children on my mind.</p><p>I'm often embarrassed about poems I've written. They make me more self-conscious than any other form of writing. Perhaps that's because they're so revealing; if you strike a false note, you lose your reader immediately (which is the problem with the one above—it's all pretense), while prose gives you a little more flexibility. On top of that, choosing poetry as a medium says a lot. Poems (and poets) tend to take themselves seriously. To be successful, they require purity of concept, of expression. You must be fully committed.</p><p>Now, here's a great poem about grief.</p><h2>FUNERAL BLUES<br>BY W. H. AUDEN</h2><p>Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,<br>Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,<br>Silence the pianos and with muffled drum<br>Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.<br>Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead<br>Scribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'.<br>Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,<br>Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.<br>He was my North, my South, my East and West,<br>My working week and my Sunday rest,<br>My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;<br>I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.<br>The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,<br>Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,<br>Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;<br>For nothing now can ever come to any good.</p><p>I don't think anyone could deny the emotional resonance there.</p><p>Should I be ashamed of silly poems I've written? No, I think not. Even less-than-stellar work tells a story, and ignoring/hiding/drowning mine as I have regularly done impairs my understanding of my own history. That's not to say that I plan to publish my "lesser works," but I don't need to delete them either.</p><p>At the time I wrote that poem, I was still facing the experience from behind a barrier. In my journal from the winter of 2005-2006, I told stories with an emotional distance that is uncomfortable for me to read now. It was journaling as performance—a performance not for my future self, but for myself as I was then. I was demonstrating my composure. I didn't know how to feel, but I knew how to record.</p><p>In the first journal entry from that time, I refer to a 10-year-old cancer patient as "a native North-Carolinian" who was "mildly condescending about it all." I got to know that kid well over the next few weeks, and when he died a month and a half later, I was more direct. I recorded everything I knew about him, from his aggressive cheating at board games to his little sister's name and age. I'm glad I did; those stories are invaluable now.</p><p>What I couldn't fully do in my journaling, however, I was attempting elsewhere. I wrote another poem while we were in that apartment, and with this one I got a little closer to communicating how I was feeling.</p><h2>POINTS OF LIGHT</h2><p>If we were all points of light,<br>would we be able to touch?<br>Or would we pass through each other<br>like disembodied fireflies<br>free from skin prisons<br>but lonely for feeling?<br>At times, I am that light;<br>I cast my body into shadow.<br>But you bring me back to myself<br>bind me into one thing<br>make me be whole, make me one.</p><p>Auden it ain't, but I feel much better about it than I do the first poem. It's not my best work, but that's not really the point, is it? With creative work, you can't <em>begin</em> focused on the result. You begin by opening yourself up as brazenly as you can, and the art follows.</p><p>And then comes the editing.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="27"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="29"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="30"><span data-reactid="31"><!-- react-empty: 32 --><h2 data-reactid="33"><a data-reactid="34">Emily Winsauer</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="37"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="38"></div></section></div></div>
